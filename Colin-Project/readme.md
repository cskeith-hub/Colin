CSS Layout: The Holy Grail
Repository name: holy-grail
Mode: solo
Type of Challenge: exercise
Duration: 1-2 days
Learning Objectives
By now you should know some HTML, and a little bit of CSS. You have worked with structuring content in a semantically correct way (using headers, paragraphs...), but CSS is so much more. A classic challenge of CSS is to visually organize the content on a page in a hierarchical way.

By the end of this challenge you will be able to:

use CSS flexbox to place block-level elements beside each other
use CSS grid to place block-level elements beside each other
create a responsive layout using CSS only, and respecting a semantic HTML structure
Your Mission
At the agency your boss came to you with a task: you need to quickly create a prototype for the home page of a new client. The structure should have a header spanning the whole width, a 3-column middle section, and a whole width footer. The wireframe they gave you looks like this:



This is conventionally called the Holy Grail Layout. Don't ask me why ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You decide to try out 2 different CSS techniques to build this page, so that you can choose the best one at the end of your work.

üå± Must haves
Create your new repository, and add 3 HTML files called: flexbox.html, grid.html.
Make sure each of the two files uses the following HTML structure:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CSS Layout - Holy Grail</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <!-- Place a title here -->
    </header>

    <nav>
      <!-- Place a list of links here -->
    </nav>

    <main>
      <!-- Place a long text here -->
    </main>

    <aside>
      <!-- Place a small image here -->
    </aside>

    <footer>
      <!-- Place a copyright notice here -->
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
Create 2 CSS files called, you guessed it: flexbox.css, grid.css.
Make sure each HTML file includes the corresponding CSS file.
In each of the CSS files you will use one of the two different techniques. You will have to do some googling to figure out how to use flexbox and grid to create the Holy Grail layout.
Create a final file called index.html: this file will only contain the links to the other two files.
Make your work available online via Netlify.
Visit your pages online, change the size and look how smoothly everything adjusts. Now repeat a thousand times and feel good about yourself.
Rules
Remember: one and only one technique per file
NO frameworks allowed üòè
Responsiveness
Make it responsive. It should have 1 breakpoint only, and it should behave like this:



üåº Nice to haves (doable)
Some time left for a challenge? Give the third technique a try!

use CSS floats to place block-level elements beside each other (naming: floats.html)
Good luck!
